README file for arduino RC car made for R3 club software task



Uses dabble (android/ios app) interface as a remote control
- side note: installed motor driver only connects to android app

Uses bluetooth as a link between the receiver and the dabble app

Direction and speed values may vary from other similar projects
- motor driver was placed in a different way, thus a little tinkering and experimenting was done to achieve the 	  intended movement of the car
